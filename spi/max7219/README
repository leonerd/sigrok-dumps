MAX7219

The logic analyser was a (cheap clone of) Salaea Logic

The probes were connected

  0 = MISO (not used by this chip)
  1 = CS
  2 = MOSI
  3 = CLK

The capture was generated using pulse-view

The chip was driven by an FTDI FT232H connected to USB, using a custom perl
program to drive the signals, including the intentional error cases.
